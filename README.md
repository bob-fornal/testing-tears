## TESTING-TEARS

This presentation is for testing JavaScript's Asynchronous Activity.

### General Notes

- [] Generate Jasmine test results for all scenarios.
- [] Build a presenter similar to what the original Async Talk does:
    [] "Test-Result Display" tab
    [] "Code View" tab

See article on details for this presentation.
